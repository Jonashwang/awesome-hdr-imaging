A collection of methods for high dynamic range imaging
High dynamic range imaging is an important topic on image processing, especially in mobile photograpyh. There are mainly two methods for HDR imaging. One method reconstructs HDR content from a single LDR image. The other is reconstructed from multi-exposure LDR images fusion, which focus on dealing with the problem of ghosting. The recent important studies are summarized here.
